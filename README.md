## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
My Project here is centered around the name of the website which is Arc Bionics. It's mainly designed and catered to
amputees who are suffering with a possibility of having no replacement or options for another arm or a leg, thus making 
it easiy accessible for them to invest in a bionic limb that functions the same as an human limb.

I wanted this project/website to be special as this is something i do take in a passionate manner as I have a relative who
has a similar situation and does not have any access to a bionic arm, so this was the main inspiration behind this website of mine.

I had taken quite a substantial amount of time as to how i could bring a design like this into action and turn it into a website.
In the UX section below you will be able to see this.

## User Experience (UX) <a name="ux"></a>

-   ### User Stories

    - ### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily navigate through the site to find content.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to browse the social links to see how known they are.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see a company logo located within the website.
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to use a form to contact the site for any queries in relation to bionics.

    - ### Site Owner Goals

        1. As a Site Owner, I want to create a very interactive website with links to allow the user to grasp clearly what is going on.
        2. As a Site Owner, I want the user to be able to submit a query using a form provided to get in contact with the company.
        3. As a Site Owner, I want the user to clearly make their way around the website with the links given as well as the social links.
        4. As a Site Owner, I want the user to be able to communicate with the company through the social links given.
        5. As a Site Owner, I want the user to view images clearly and to be able to view what the main purpose of the site is.

    - ### Font Selection 

    - I had chosen a universal font to be used across the whole of the website as this made styling easy and had fit in well with the theme of my website.
      The Font I had chosen was [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans?query=noto+sa)

- ### Colour Choice 

    - When considering the colour theme of my website in the pre planning phase, I had to choose a theme that combined colours effortlessly
      and ensure that there would be no confusion so the user does not get distracted by the colours used. 

      The Images and text colour had contrasted the theme of the logo and website well, so I had chosen a mix of colours which include; Black, White, Grey and 
      a shade of yellow as seen below.

      <h2 align="center"><img src="/documentation/readme/Color-Pallete-Site.png"></h2>

- ### Logo Creation

    - When Creating the Logo in the pre planning phase, I had to make sure If i wanted the logo present at the header of the website or just the text to be 
      made as responsive. Upon further thinking, I had then decided to add the logo within the site itself so it was embedded.
      
    - I wanted the Logo to have a futuristic touch to it as bionics is something of the future and enables the user to think bionics are the future 
      and will be quickly in development as it will under go trials to be used in the NHS.
    
    - The Logo was created entirely by my own design as well as the image by using the online resource called [Logo Makr](https://logomakr.com).

## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

- ### Creation

    - I had created the wireframes as a draft and How I wanted the layout to be in the final website.
      Upon comparing the wireframes and the final design, there are subtle changes in regards to the form and various elements.
    
    - My Wireframes focus on the basic layout structure of the website and then identifying how it would look across multiple devices.
 

    - The Wireframes that I had developed were in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

### Testing User Stories from UX Section

- ### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily navigate through the site to find content.

        1. When Entering the site, users are greeted with a vast image with an effect to capture the user's interest.
            This is reinforced with a ethos which states "The Future of Movement Is Here".
        2. A Navigation Bar is present for ease of accessibility, and as this is a one page website, users can click any link within the
            navigation bar and it will directly take the user to that area of the website. This itself adds ease of navigation and ensures
            there is fluidity within the website.
        
        <h2 align="center"><img src="/documentation/readme/userstory-2.png"></h2>
    
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to browse the social links to see how known they are.

        1. The website contains a footer with interactive links to choose that will take you to further social sites to learn more about the company itself and opens in another tab, leaving the website in a tab of its own.

        <h2 align="center"><img src="/documentation/readme/userstory-1.png"></h2>

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to use a form to contact the site for any queries in relation to bionics.


        1. The website has a seperate page labelled as 'Contact Us'. This page has a clear and concise form to interact with.
        2. The form itself is clearly labelled and does not let you submit  unless you fill in all the fields which is good user experience.

        <h2 align="center"><img src="/documentation/readme/visitor-stories-form.png"></h2>
    
     ## Further Testing

     - The Website was viewed on multiple devices, iPhone XS/6s and 7 Plus, Desktop, iPad and Huawei P30 Lite.
     - Continuous testing took place to ensure the pages were linked correctly and that images were shown with no marginal errors across the screen.
     - Family members were asked to test the website for me and their stories can be found below;
    
    
    ## Further Testing Stories (Family)
    - "Upon entering the website, the structure was clear and I could make my way around with ease with easily navigational links placed at the top."

    - "The Gallery/portfolio section responds well on both mobile and desktop with both margins at the side to ensure the images are centered."

    - "Footer placed well and social links and styling match the theme of the website. The links itself open in a new tab to ensure the website stays open."
